I'm a software engineer with experience over 5 years in various industries. My role is flexible, I work as a full stack developer, so I have experience on many sides, including a frontend with React/Next, the Backend with Node/Go, and the cloud with Google Cloud.

#### Boilerplate
I created some boilerplates to develop an application:
1. Next.JS Boilerplate, [nextjs-pro](https://github.com/didikmulyadi/nextjs-pro)
2. 🛠️ NPM Package Creator, [npm-package-creator](https://github.com/didikmulyadi/npm-package-creator).

#### NPM Package
I created some NPM Packages to help my work and also all of the software engineers:
1. 🛠️ Nest API Docs with multiple UI [nest-api-docs](https://github.com/didikmulyadi/nest-api-docs).
